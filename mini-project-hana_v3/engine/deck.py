"""Deck utilities.

This engine treats cards as indistinguishable except by suit. Instead of an
ordered list "deck", we model the remaining cards as a multiset:

    remaining_card_counts[suit] = how many cards of that suit remain

The `Deck` class owns that multiset and provides the chance-node helpers:
- Enumerating distinct draw/deal sequences (ordered, without replacement)
- Computing exact probabilities for those sequences
- Sampling random deals/draws by remaining suit counts
